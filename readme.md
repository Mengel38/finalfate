# The Final Fate

## The Project

I decided to train JavaScript in my spare-time. I am in the creation of a HTML 5 space game. Your goal is it to successfully win all levels by shooting the bad guys down and challenging the level bosses. You can control the game with the arrow keys and the space key on your keyboard or go ahead and use a GamePad with an analogue stick and a designated fire button (chosen by pressing it on the title screen). Keep in my that this feature is experimental and only applicable for Firefox browsers right now.


## The Goal
The goal is to be fully compatible with modern Firefox and Chromium/Chrome browsers, while featuring a playable and fun space game with six levels.



## Play the current version
Test players are needed! So, you can just download all the files or clone the repository and begin by opening the index.html file. Feel free to give feedback via the Issues function.



## Licensing
Fork the repository and feel free to do with the source code whatever you want. You should edit (add your own name/nick/handle) the copyright notice on the title screen if you plan to distribute the software somehow. 


## Collaboration
As the nature of this project is personal skill development, collaboration is not (a planned) part of it. But you can pick something from the Issues list, let me know about it and create a Pull Request from your fork to my main repo. Please declare if and how you want to be credited in the request notes.
